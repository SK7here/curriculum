# Flutter

## About 

Flutter is a cross-platform app development SDK developed by Google. It has some amazing features like stateful hot reload which make development faster, easier and smoother. No wonder Flutter is the new trend in cross-platform app development. This is the perfect time to learn Flutter, and get ready to build the truly cross-platform apps of the future (which is very, very near BTW). To learn more about Flutter, please visit [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev/).
